# TheAccessabilityProject
The vision for this website is to create an online platform where you can link to other websites and receive the article in a more accessible format.

For example; if you were to link to a wikipedia page you would have the option of having it read back to you in the language of your choosing. 

Worth noting is that I do not at the time of writing this, know how perfectly I will be able to follow the WCAG Accessiblity guidelines. This depends both on technical issues as well as how timeconsuming some of the parts will be. But the end goal is so that anyone, through this website, is able to take part and understand the information on any or most websites. For this project however it will probably be restricted to wikipedia articles or maybe that and newsarticles, depending on how difficult it proves to be.
